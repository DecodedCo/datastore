**AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ Stocks Histories** files contain daily historical data of 8,032 stock tickers on AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ \(in separate .csv files\) until March 1, 2019. Information includes opening and closing prices, highest and lowest prices of the day, volume of the day, and adjusted closing price of the day. The original data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/qks1lver/amex-nyse-nasdaq-stock-histories), while information on the stocks found in the separate AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ .csv files can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/qks1lver/redtide).

The [**Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development \(Finance\)**](https://stats.oecd.org/) has a plethora of metadata for member and some non-member nations. The Finance tab  includes downloadable data including, but not limited to: bank profitability, central government debt, financial and insurance statistics, pensions, SME financing, and more. We have included a small subset of data for you to use should you be unable to access the OECD metadata.
