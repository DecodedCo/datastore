**AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ Stocks Histories** files contain daily historical data of 8,032 stock tickers on AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ \(in separate .csv files\) until March 1, 2019.

The original data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/qks1lver/amex-nyse-nasdaq-stock-histories), while information on the stocks found in the separate AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ .csv files can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/qks1lver/redtide).

[**The Word Bank Global Financial Development Report 2017 / 2018: Bankers without Borders** ](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/gfdr/data/global-financial-development-database)is an extensive data set of financial system characteristics for 214 economies. It contains annual data, starting from 1960, and includes measures of \(1\) depth, \(2\) access, \(3\) efficiency, and \(4\) stability of financial systems. Each of these characteristics captures both \(1\) financial institutions \(banks, insurance companies, etc.\), and \(2\) financial markets, such as stock and bond markets. We have included a small subset of data for you to use should you not be able to access the World Bank Development Report data. 

The [**Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development \(Finance\)**](https://stats.oecd.org/) has a plethora of metadata for member and some non-member nations. The Finance tab  includes downloadable data including, but not limited to: bank profitability, central government debt, financial and insurance statistics, pensions, SME financing, and more. We have included a small subset of data for you to use should you be unable to access the OECD metadata.
