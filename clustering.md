# Clustering

[**The Word Bank Global Financial Development Report 2017 / 2018: Bankers without Borders** ](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/gfdr/data/global-financial-development-database)is an extensive data set of financial system characteristics for 214 economies. It contains annual data, starting from 1960, and includes measures of \(1\) depth, \(2\) access, \(3\) efficiency, and \(4\) stability of financial systems. Each of these characteristics captures both \(1\) financial institutions \(banks, insurance companies, etc.\), and \(2\) financial markets, such as stock and bond markets. We have included a small subset of data for you to use should you not be able to access the World Bank Development Report data.
