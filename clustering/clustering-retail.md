# Clustering: Retail

[**Tobacco Advertising Study \(2008 and 2011\)**](https://github.com/DecodedCo/datastore/raw/master/data/Tobacco_Advertising_Study__2008_2011.csv.zip) contains data from the California Tobacco Advertising Survey \(CTAS\), showing the percentage and total number of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy or below three feet, in 2008 and 2011, broken down by store type. Data is originally from [**Data World**](https://data.world/chhs/tobacco-advertising-study). More information can be found there.
