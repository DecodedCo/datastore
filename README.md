# Welcome

In this GitBook, you will find a selection of data sets that can be used for exercises throughout the Data Academy. Many of these data sets can be used across multiple modules. You will be able to choose from 'cleaned' data sets, or \(if you are up for the challenge\) 'uncleaned' data sets. 

To get started, choose the appropriate module in the menu to the left-hand side. For each module page, you will find a list of data sets that you can download.
