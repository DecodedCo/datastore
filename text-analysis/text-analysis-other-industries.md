# Text Analysis: Other Industries

[**President Trump's 56 speeches**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/trump_full_speech.txt.zip) from June 2015 to November 9, 2016 is something a bit different \(and maybe a bit entertaining\) if you are feeling adventurous. It is useful for practicing Bag of Words models and text analysis visualisations. The original data source is from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/PedramNavid/trump_speeches).

[**Game of Thrones \(battles\)**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/game%20of%20thrones%20battles.csv.zip) dataset is a small, fun set of data that contains information about major battles \(attackers, defenders, battle size and names,  deaths, locations, etc.\) in this HBO series. More information can be found [**here**](https://data.world/data-society/game-of-thrones).
