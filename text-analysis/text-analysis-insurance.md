# Text Analysis: Insurance

**The Enron email dataset** contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. The emails were obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse in 2001. The file attached here is a _small subset_ of the complete dataset. More information can be found [**here**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/), and the complete dataset \(1.4 GB\) can be found on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset)**.**
