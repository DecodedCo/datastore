[**Retail Sales Index \(internet sales\)**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/ONS%20retail%20internet%20sales.zip) is a subset of data taken from the [**Office of National Statistics**](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/datasets/retailsalesindexinternetsales), detailing monthly and yearly internet sales of various goods \(by store type\) in the UK. The dataset attached here contains two .csv files: 

* Average weekly sales in £ million for different store types and total sales \(seasonally adjusted\)
* Average weekly value in £ million of retail vs. internet goods, and internet sales as a percentage of total sales \(not seasonally adjusted\)
