# Regression: Other

[**North Korea Missile Tests Database**](https://github.com/DecodedCo/datastore/raw/master/data/North%20Korea%20Missile%20Tests.zip) is the first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea that can deliver a payload of at least 500 kilograms to a distance of at least 300 kilometres. More information on the database can be found at [**NTI**](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/). The file contains the following documents:

* three .csv files with missile information \(test data, success/failure, number, time, facility and location, missile type, source information\)
* a .pdf file describing how the tests are recorded, the variable measures, and how the information is categorised
