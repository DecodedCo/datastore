# Text Analysis

### DATASETS

\*\*\*\*[**Financial Tweets of Publicly Traded Companies**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/financial-tweets.zip) contains information on 28k+ tweets about publicly traded companies \(and some cryptocurrencies\) that are tagged with the company they are tweeting about. The folder contains the following files: 1\) a data set with  tweets said, the tweet time stamps, URL of the original tweets, what company and/or organisation made the tweets, and the public company \(and its symbol\) being tweeted about; and 2\) a reference spreadsheet detailing the company symbols and the full name. The original data source can be found [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/davidwallach/financial-tweets)**.**

[**Tweets about US airline sentiments**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/twitter-airline-sentiment.csv.zip) contains information on tweets made in February 2015 about performance of major US airlines and sentiment values for each tweet. The original sentiment analysis and twitter data can be found at [**Data Society**](https://data.world/data-society/twitters-about-us-airline) and [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment).

\*\*\*\*[**This text file of President Trump's 56 speeches**](https://github.com/MaurissaCM/Decoded-DA-Datastore/raw/master/data/trump_full_speech.txt.zip) from June 2015 to November 9, 2016 is something a bit different \(and maybe a bit entertaining\) if you are feeling adventurous. It is good for practicing Bag of Words models and text analysis visualisations. The original data source is from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/PedramNavid/trump_speeches).
