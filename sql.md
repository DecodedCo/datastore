### DATA SOURCES

\*\*\*\*[**The World Bank: Financial Sector Indicator**](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) is an online data base where you can download information on multiple financial indicators \(information on indicators [here](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/g20fidata/)\) measured over the past few decades at global and individual country levels. You can choose which indicators, country\(ies\), and time spans you would like to use to make your own data set for personal use. 

[**The Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development \(Finance\)**](https://stats.oecd.org/) has a plethora of metadata for member and some non-member nations. The Finance tab  includes downloadable data including, but not limited to: bank profitability, central government debt, financial and insurance statistics, pensions, SME financing, and more. 

\*\*\*\*[**A Millennium of Macroeconomic Data for the UK \(1086-2016\)**](https://www.kaggle.com/bank-of-england/a-millennium-of-macroeconomic-data) is a very large dataset that contains macroeconomic and financial information spanning mostly from the 12th century to present-day \(one or two benchmark estimates from 1086, the year of the Domesday Book\). The .xls file contains the original data from the Bank of England, including  hundreds of time series data. The .csv file is an extract of several dozen headline time series from the .xls file.
